# EGEL-Model

This project provides code of EGEL (Embedding Geographic Locations), a model for learning vector space embeddings of geographic locations, using Flickr tags and structured information extracted from various scientific resources. The structured information can be of two forms numerical and categorical information. 

The model is general and can be used to integrate any textual, numerical and categorical features into one low dimensional vector space embedding regardless of the source of the data and evaluation task. This implementation using Python-TensorFlow, a "library for numerical computation using data flow graphs" by Google. 

If you use this code in your research, please refer to this paper “Embedding Geographic Locations for Modelling the Natural Environment using Flickr Tags and Structured Data” by Shelan S. Jeawak, Christopher B. Jones, and Steven Schockaert.
